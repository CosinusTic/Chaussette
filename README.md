# Description
A simple local multiplayer game: the "server" project is a socket that listens
to incoming TCP requests.

The socket will server as coordinator for event handling, making sure data is
sync'ed accross all client instances.

The idea for the game is for now to be able to run multiple instances 
at once in a game "lobby" (unique lobby)

## Ideas for future developments
- Lobby creation
- Player interactions
